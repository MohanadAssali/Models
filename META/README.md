### Key Improvements from previous models
- **DCF Model (Multiple Approaches, Sensitivity Tables)**
# Meta Inc. (META)
The valuation provides dual prespective on Meta. While Comparative analysis suggest undervaluation relative to peers (16.2x vs 18.8x median), the DCF model yields intrinsic value of 675.94$ assuming  a 20% CAGR over 5 year period ending FY2030. This confirms that the market share price is fairly valued provided that Meta's massive AI infrastructure spending continue. I view Meta as a 'HOLD' with upside potential.
